# DATS-6303-Deep-Learning-project
Final project for the DATS 6303 Deep Learning course, spring 2024. 

The project is aimed at employing time series prediction approach for music generation using deep neural netowkrs. The models explored were GRU, LSTM (stacked and bidirectional), and Multi-head attention-based LSTM. The idea is to first represemt the music symbolically and then convert the sequences into a time series like representation. The models are trained on dataset of 5000+ folk songs melodies and after training, the model is given a melody seed to extrapolate further to a fixed number of time steps.
